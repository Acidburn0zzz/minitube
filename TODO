# Minitube TODO list

## Known Bugs
- Wrong item positions when moving more than one item down or up

## Killer features

- Video download
    Playlist items should have a download icon that appears on mouse hover.
    Once the icon is clicked a mini-progressbar appears and the download icon remains visible
    even on "mouseout", maybe with a different color.
    Videos should be downloaded in HD format, if available.
    Videos should be downloaded directly on the Desktop without asking for a location.

- YouTube related videos
    List of related videos identical to the playlist.
    When a related video is clicked Minitube will keep playing the next related videos.
    Don't know where the list should appear, maybe on the right, but when activated it should replace the playlist.
    Maybe the playlist should disappear, leaving only the panel on the right.

- Accept YouTube URLs in the search box and as CLI args
    ./minitube [url]
    When Minitube has a single video to play, it will continue playing related videos.
    This feature depends on the related videos above.
    We could also accept any URL and scrape web pages searching for YouTube videos.

- Windows build
    Stefan Brueck has compiled on Windows but there are problems with Phonon's directX backend
    Marco di Antonio tried with the Mplayer backend, but it is very unstable

- Subtitles, see http://google2srt.sourceforge.net/

## Minor Features
- Clear recent keywords
- Safe search levels (in the status bar beside HD)
- Show buffering progress (when Phonon backends will work)
- Mark playlist items that have errors

## Unsure features
