# Minitube TODO list

## Bugs
- Item positions when moving two items down
- Truncate overflowing text in the playlist
- Fix Space key not working in fullscreen (Pause)


## Killer features

- Video download
    Playlist items should have small a download icon that appears on mouse hover.
    Once the icon is clicked a mini-progressbar appears and the the download icon remains visible
    even on "mouseout", maybe with a different color.
    Videos should be downloaded in HD format, if available.

- YouTube related videos
    List of related videos identical to the playlist.
    When a related video is clicked Minitube will keep playing the next related videos.
    Don't know where the list should appear, maybe on the right, but when activated it should replace the playlist.
    Maybe the playlist should disappear, leaving only the panel on the right.

- Accept YouTube URLs in the search box and as CLI args
    ./minitube [url]
    When Minitube has a single video to play, it will continue playing related videos.
    This feature is depends on the related videos above.
    We could also accept any URL and scrape web pages searching for YouTube videos.

- Windows build
    Stefan Brueck has compiled on Windows but there are problems with Phonon

- HD streaming (requires settings)
- Subtitles, see http://google2srt.sourceforge.net/


## Features
- Show buffering progress (when Phonon backends will work)
- Clear recent keywords
- Mark playlist items that have errors
- Settings: number of "Recent Keywords", Phonon settings, HD or not
- Show the toolbar when mouse hits the top of the screen in Fullscreen mode with animation
- Show the playlist when mouse hits the left side of the screen in Fullscreen mode with animation
- Show more thumbs on hover with animated crossfade

## Unsure features
- Add menu entries for Most relevant, Most recent, Most viewed (Playlist => ...)
- Saved playlists
- Starred videos
- Investigate fetchMore() and canFetchMore() in the Model/View API

## Phonon bugs (Come on Qt devs, do your job!)
- Mac: playback sometimes does not start (got a workaround!)
- Mac: Phonon freezes the GUI when loading a video
- Phonon::MediaSource does not work with QIODevices
- Cannot seek beyond the buffered part of the video
- Linux: Seek does not work at all
- Phonon does not report the buffering percent correctly
