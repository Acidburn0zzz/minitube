# Minitube TODO list

## Killer features

- Video download
    Download status on the status bar. When clicked, a download manager view appears.
    Videos should be downloaded in the current format
    directly on the Desktop or Downloads dir without asking for a location.

- YouTube related videos
    List of related videos identical to the playlist.
    When a related video is clicked Minitube will keep playing the next related videos.
    Don't know where the list should appear, maybe on the right, but when activated it should replace the playlist.
    Maybe the playlist should disappear, leaving only the panel on the right.

- Accept YouTube URLs in the search box and as CLI args
    ./minitube [url]
    When Minitube has a single video to play, it will continue playing related videos.
    This feature depends on the related videos above.
    We could also accept any URL and scrape web pages searching for YouTube videos.

- Windows build
    Stefan Brueck has compiled on Windows but there are problems with Phonon's directX backend
    Marco di Antonio tried with the Mplayer backend, but it is very unstable

- Subtitles, see http://google2srt.sourceforge.net/

## Minor Features
- Safe search levels (in the status bar beside HD)
- Show buffering progress (when Phonon backends will work)
- Show more thumbs on hover with animated crossfade
- Time filter on the bottom of the playlist: Today, 7 days, 30 days

## Unsure features
- Restore status when a recent keyword is clicked: skipped videos, sortBar and play time
- Add menu entries for Most relevant, Most recent, Most viewed (Playlist => ...)
- Saved playlists
- Starred videos

## Phonon bugs (Come on Qt and KDE devs, do your job!)
- Mac: playback sometimes does not start (got a workaround!)
- Mac: Phonon freezes the GUI when loading a video
- Phonon::MediaSource does not work with QIODevices
- Mac: Cannot seek beyond the buffered part of the video
- Xine: Seek does not work at all. https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197927
- Phonon does not report the buffering percent correctly. https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210336
- Linux: The Phonon volume slider mute button does not change: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214543
