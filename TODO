# Minitube TODO list

## Major features

- Features for logged in users:
    * Channel subscriptions (r/w)
    * Favorite videos (r/w)
    * Comments (r/w)
    * Likes (r/w)

- Related videos
    List of related videos identical to the playlist.
    When a related video is clicked Minitube will keep playing the next related videos.
    Don't know where the list should appear, maybe on the right, but when activated it should replace the playlist.
    Maybe the playlist should disappear, leaving only the panel on the right.

- Info view
    Displays video metadata. Could be somewhat linked with related videos...

- Subtitles, see http://google2srt.sourceforge.net/

## Minor Features
- Stop after this video
- Always on top
- Accessibility
- Support YouTube URLs drag'n'drop from browser
- Search for playlists http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#Searching_for_Playlists
- Safe search levels (in the status bar beside the video definition option)
- Show more thumbs on hover with animated crossfade
- Time filter on the bottom of the playlist: Today, 7 days, 30 days
- Accept any URL and scrape web pages searching for YouTube videos.
- Accept YouTube URLs as CLI args and tell the running Minitube instance

## Unsure features
- Restore status when a recent keyword is clicked: skipped videos, sortBar and play time
- Add menu entries for Most relevant, Most recent, Most viewed (Playlist => ...)
- Saved playlists
- Starred videos

## Phonon bugs
- Phonon::MediaSource does not work with QIODevices (this needs to work to implement seeking)

## Phonon bugs that do not apply to Minitube anymore
- Mac: playback sometimes does not start (got a workaround!)
- Mac: Phonon freezes the GUI when loading a video
- Mac: Cannot seek beyond the buffered part of the video
- Xine: Seek does not work at all. https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197927
- Phonon does not report the buffering percent correctly. https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210336
- Linux: The Phonon volume slider mute button does not change: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214543
