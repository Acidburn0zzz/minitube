# Minitube TODO list

## Bugs
- in fullscreen mode at the right screen in a dual-screen setup,
    will show the song list at the left when working on the left screen.

## Killer features

- Related videos
    List of related videos identical to the playlist.
    When a related video is clicked Minitube will keep playing the next related videos.
    Don't know where the list should appear, maybe on the right, but when activated it should replace the playlist.
    Maybe the playlist should disappear, leaving only the panel on the right.

- Subtitles, see http://google2srt.sourceforge.net/

## Minor Features
- Search for playlists http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#Searching_for_Playlists
- Safe search levels (in the status bar beside HD)
- Show more thumbs on hover with animated crossfade
- Time filter on the bottom of the playlist: Today, 7 days, 30 days
- Accept any URL and scrape web pages searching for YouTube videos.
- Accept YouTube URLs as CLI args

## Unsure features
- Restore status when a recent keyword is clicked: skipped videos, sortBar and play time
- Add menu entries for Most relevant, Most recent, Most viewed (Playlist => ...)
- Saved playlists
- Starred videos
