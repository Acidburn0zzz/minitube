# Build instructions

## Prerequisites
To compile Minitube you need at least Qt 4.5, Qt >= 4.6 is recommended.
The following Qt modules are needed: core, gui, network, sql, script, xml, dbus, phonon

On a Debian or Ubuntu system type:
sudo apt-get install build-essential qt4-dev-tools libphonon-dev

## Compiling
Run:
    $ qmake
and then:
    $ make
Beware of the Qt3 or Qt5 version of qmake! If things go wrong try running qmake-qt4 instead.

## Running
./build/target/minitube

## A word about Phonon on Linux
To be able to actually watch videos you need a working Phonon setup.
Please don't contact me about this, ask for help on your distribution support channels.

These days Minitube is tested with the VLC backend only.
Please don't report bugs with other backends as they're not supported.

## Installing on Linux
Run:
    $ sudo make install
This is for packagers. End users should not install applications in this way.
