# Build instructions

## Prerequisites

To compile Minitube you need Qt >= 4.5 installed.

On a Debian or Ubuntu system just type:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential qt4-dev-tools

Windows and Mac users can get the Qt libraries from:
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

## Compiling

Compiling on Linux is fairly easy. Just run:
    qmake
and then
    make

Beware of the Qt3 version of qmake! If things go wrong try running qmake-qt4 instead.

## Running

Just type:
    ./build/target/minitube

## The visual way

There is also a visual way to build and run Qt apps.
Download the Qt SDK from:
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
And then open `minitube.pro` with Qt Creator.
